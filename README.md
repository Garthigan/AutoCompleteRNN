# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - In-Class 3 Notebook 

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **`MA4144InClass3(RNN).ipynb`**, which explores the implementation and theory behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This notebook is part of the coursework for **MA4144** and is designed to demonstrate concepts and hands-on coding exercises related to sequence modeling and RNNs.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction**  
   Overview of RNNs, their applications, and importance in sequence modeling.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   Details about the dataset used for training and testing the RNN.

3. **RNN Implementation**  
   Code snippets and explanations for constructing and training an RNN.

4. **Results and Analysis**  
   Visualization and discussion of the model’s performance.

5. **Conclusion**  
   Summary of the findings and potential next steps for further exploration.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Essential libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas (specific requirements may be detailed in the notebook).

## How to Use the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, check the imports in the notebook and install manually.)*

3. Launch the notebook:
